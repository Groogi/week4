### Preface:
_During the project I had some issues when it came to running the buttonClicked(); function. After following the workshop directly and searching through docs I was still unable to come to a solution. Below I've included the two strange errors I kept seeing. I think the code for all the work is correct besides what is causing these weird errors..._
